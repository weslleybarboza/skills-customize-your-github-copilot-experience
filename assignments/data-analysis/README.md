# 📘 Assignment: Data Analysis

## 🎯 Objective

Learn the basics of data analysis in Python by loading, exploring, visualizing, and interpreting a real dataset. Practice using pandas for data manipulation and matplotlib/seaborn for visualization.

## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️ Data Loading & Exploration

#### Description
Load the provided CSV dataset (`data.csv`) and perform basic exploration to understand its structure and contents.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:
- Load the CSV file using Python (e.g., pandas)
- Display the first 5 rows of the dataset
- Show summary statistics (mean, median, etc.) for numeric columns

Example output:
```python
	col1  col2  col3
0     1     5     9
1     2     6    10
...
```

### 🛠️ Data Visualization & Insights

#### Description
Create visualizations to help understand the data and summarize key findings.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:
- Generate at least two different types of plots (e.g., histogram, scatter plot)
- Identify and describe at least two insights or trends from the data (write your observations as comments or markdown)
- Save the plots as image files (e.g., `histogram.png`, `scatter.png`)

Example output:
```python
# histogram.png and scatter.png saved in your folder
# Insights: "Column col1 shows a normal distribution..."
```
