## 🎯 Objective

Build a classic Hangman game where players guess letters to reveal a hidden word before running out of attempts. This assignment will help you practice string manipulation, loops, conditionals, and random selection in Python.

## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️	Hangman Game Implementation

#### Description
Create a complete Hangman game that randomly selects words from a predefined list and allows players to guess letters one at a time. The game should provide visual feedback on progress and track remaining attempts.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Randomly select words from a predefined list of at least 10 words
- Display the word as underscores initially (e.g., "_ _ _ _ _")
- Accept single letter guesses from the player
- Update the display to show correctly guessed letters in their positions
- Track and display the number of incorrect guesses remaining
- End the game when the word is completely guessed (win) or attempts are exhausted (lose)
- Display appropriate win/lose messages with the correct word
- Handle invalid input (non-letters, repeated guesses) gracefully
